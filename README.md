### Project Description
The Women's Safety Application is an intuitive and reliable mobile and desktop app designed to provide a quick and effective emergency response for women. In dangerous or distressing situations, users can easily trigger alerts to notify their emergency contacts and authorities. The app instantly shares the user's real-time location and sends an SMS and email alert, ensuring help is on the way. With features like emergency alerts, location sharing, and direct communication with safety contacts, this app is an essential tool for personal safety and peace of mind.

Whether in transit or at home, the Women's Safety Application empowers women to take control of their safety by providing a seamless and discreet way to alert others when they need hel

### The Problem statement
[In today‚Äôs world, personal safety remains a major concern, especially for women who are often vulnerable to various threats in their daily lives. Many women face situations where immediate assistance is required, but they may be unable to effectively communicate their distress or share their location quickly. This lack of rapid and reliable response mechanisms can lead to delays in help, further increasing the risk of harm.

Currently, there is a need for a simple and efficient solution that allows women to quickly send an emergency alert, notify their loved ones, and share their precise location in real-time. Additionally, many existing safety apps are either too complex, not user-friendly, or lack the integration of crucial features such as SMS and email notifications to ensure that help reaches them without delay.

The Women's Safety Application aims to address this issue by providing a user-friendly interface that allows quick emergency alerts with real-time location sharing, ensuring women can receive timely help when they need it the most. This solution integrates SMS, email notifications, and location tracking in one seamless app to provide a reliable safety net for women everywhere.]

### The Solution
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [python]
- [Flask (Backend)

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, which is used to build the backend of the Women's Safety Application. It allows easy creation of RESTful APIs that handle emergency alerts, send SMS notifications through Twilio, and send email alerts through an SMTP server. Flask's simplicity and extensibility make it ideal for this project, where a fast and reliable backend is needed.
PyQt6 (Frontend)

PyQt6 is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework, used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Women's Safety Application. It provides the tools to design desktop applications with interactive windows, buttons, and other components. The PyQt6 framework makes it easy to build a user-friendly interface that works across various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Twilio (SMS Integration)

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that provides APIs for sending SMS messages, making phone calls, and other communication services. Twilio is used in the Women's Safety Application to send emergency SMS alerts to contacts when a distress signal is triggered.
Geocoder (Location Tracking)

Geocoder is a Python library used to retrieve location information based on an IP address. It allows the Women's Safety Application to get the user's real-time location and share it with emergency contacts and authorities via Google Maps links.
Flask-CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Flask-CORS is used to enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) between the backend (Flask API) and the frontend (PyQt6 application). This ensures that the frontend can securely send requests to the Flask API, even if they are running from different domains or ports.
These frameworks and libraries were carefully selected to ensure the Women's Safety Application is lightweight, easy to use, and scalable, providing fast and reliable emergency alerts and location tracking for the user.
