### Project Description
[This project is a Women's Safety App that provides a quick way to send emergency alerts with the user's location, as well as share their location through a map. The app integrates a front-end graphical user interface (GUI) with a back-end service for processing and dispatching alerts]

### The Problem statement
[In today's world, ensuring personal safety, especially for women, is a growing concern. With increasing incidents of violence, harassment, and emergencies, there is a need for a reliable and accessible solution that can provide immediate assistance in times of crisis.]

### The Solution
[The solution to the problem of personal safety, especially for women in emergency situations, is a Women‚Äôs Safety Application that provides a seamless and immediate way to send alerts and share locations. This solution combines a desktop/mobile application with a backend server that uses modern tools and technologies to ensure effective communication in case of an emergency.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [programming languages: Python is the main programming language used for the entire application (both backend and frontend). Python is used to develop the PyQt6 GUI, handle backend logic (Flask server), send SMS and email notifications, and fetch the user‚Äôs location]
- 
- [framework:PyQt6 (Framework for GUI)
-  Flask (Web Framework for Backend)
-  Twilio API (Messaging Framework for SMS Notification
-  Flask-CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Middleware)]
-  
- [Libraries used PyQt6: For GUI development.
Flask: For backend development and API handling.
Twilio: For sending SMS alerts.
Flask-CORS: For enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
Geocoder: For fetching the user‚Äôs location.
Requests: For sending HTTP requests between frontend and backend.
smtplib: For sending email alerts.
Threading: For running Flask server in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive:]

- [Tools used Python: Core programming language.
PyCharm/VS Code: IDE for Python development.
Flask Development Server: For running the backend locally.
Twilio Console: For managing SMS sending and Twilio API configuration.
Google Maps: For sharing location via a URL.
SMTP Server (Gmail): For sending email alerts.
Git/GitHub: Version control and collaboration.
ngrok: Exposing local Flask server to the internet for testing (optional).
Jupyter Notebook: For testing code (optional).
Virtual Environment (venv): For managing Python project dependencies.]

For Hardware:
- [List main components Smartphone/Desktop/Laptop: The main device running the app.
GPS Module: For fetching the user's location (built-in or external).
Internet Connectivity: Wi-Fi or Cellular network required for communication.
SMS and Email Interfaces: Mobile network for SMS, internet connectivity for email alerts.
Microphone & Speaker: Optional hardware for voice and sound-based alerts.
Battery: Ensures continuous app usage during emergencies.
Web Browser: For location sharing via Google Maps.
Cloud Services/Backend Servers: Hosting the Flask backend and external services.]

- [List specifications System Requirements: Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) or mobile device with GPS and internet.
Libraries: Python 3.7+, PyQt6, Flask, Twilio, Geocoder, smtplib.
Functional Features: Emergency alert sending (SMS/email), location sharing (Google Maps), user interface.
Security: Encryption for data transmission, HTTPS for secure API calls.
Performance: Fast backend response and notification delivery.
Deployment: Desktop executable, cloud-based backend deployment. ]

- [List tools requiredDevelopment Tools:

IDE: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text
Version Control: Git, GitHub/GitLab
Frontend: PyQt6, Qt Designer (optional), PyInstaller
Backend: Flask, Flask-CORS, Postman
Libraries:

Python: Requests, Geocoder, Twilio SDK, smtplib, Flask, Flask-CORS, python-dotenv
Testing: pytest, unittest
Deployment:

Cloud: Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud
Docker (optional), AWS CLI, Google Cloud SDK
PyInstaller (for frontend packaging)
Third-Party Services:

Twilio (SMS), SMTP (Email)
Monitoring & Logging:
